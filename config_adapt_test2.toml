scenario = """
Today, we had a bit of a challenging moment at the pet shop.\
My daughter was really looking forward to getting her fish tank, but it turned out it wasn't ready yet. \
To make things trickier, we were in a public place, and her brother had just received his birthday present, which made her feel even more upset. \
I could see she was holding back tears, so I comforted her with a hug and told her I understood why she was sad. \
I apologized and reassured her that it was okay to feel that way.\
She started sobbing, and I hugged her again, promising that we would call the pet shop tomorrow to check on the fish tank. \
It felt good to know that the situation didn't escalate further, as it could have gone very differently. \
If I could give advice to a younger version of myself, I would say that it's okay to let her be upset sometimes and to let her know she can express her feelings. \
Staying calm and supportive can really make a difference.
