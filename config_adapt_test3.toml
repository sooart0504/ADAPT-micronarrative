What is it about this part of your life that you deeply value—or want to hold onto in the years ahead?",

What kind of presence do they carry? How do they move through their day? How do they show up for others—and for themselves? (Try describing them in third person: “This person is someone who…”)",

    "Do you believe that version of you could become real someday? You don’t have to be 100% sure—just share what feels true right now. Is there a part of this person that already exists in you?",
    "Thinking about where you are now and that future version of you… How far in the future do you imagine becoming this person—realistically? Maybe a few years? 10 or more? There’s no right answer—whatever timeline feels right to you is totally okay."

scenario = """
Today, we had a bit of a challenging moment at the pet shop.\
My daughter was really looking forward to getting her fish tank, but it turned out it wasn't ready yet. \
To make things trickier, we were in a public place, and her brother had just received his birthday present, which made her feel even more upset. \
I could see she was holding back tears, so I comforted her with a hug and told her I understood why she was sad. \
I apologized and reassured her that it was okay to feel that way.\
She started sobbing, and I hugged her again, promising that we would call the pet shop tomorrow to check on the fish tank. \
It felt good to know that the situation didn't escalate further, as it could have gone very differently. \
If I could give advice to a younger version of myself, I would say that it's okay to let her be upset sometimes and to let her know she can express her feelings. \
Staying calm and supportive can really make a difference.
